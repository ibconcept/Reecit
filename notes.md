<!-- Install Dependencies:

Install the required Python packages listed in your requirements.txt file:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Database Setup:

If you're using Flask-Migrate or a similar database migration tool, initialize the database and apply the initial migration:
bash
Copy code
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
flask db upgrade
Run the Application:

Start your Flask application by running the main.py file:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Your Flask application should now be running locally.
 You can access it at http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
Development Workflow:

Start by implementing the desired functionality in your Flask routes and templates.
Use the Flask development server to test your application locally.
As you make changes, Flask's built-in debugger will provide feedback in the terminal.
Test your application thoroughly, both manually and with automated tests if available.
Commit your changes to version control frequently to track your progress.
Deployment:

Once your application is ready for production, deploy it to a production
 server. Common options include platforms like Heroku, AWS, or a dedicated server.
Configure your production environment according to your application's needs,
 including setting up a production-grade database (e.g., PostgreSQL) and 
 configuring web servers like Nginx or Apache to serve your Flask application. -->
